# Eingrad
A small project of mine, to satisfy my curiosity about the einstein summation feature in PyTorch. I'm planning to rewrite most of deep learning architecture with einsum if possible. Maybe I'll go a bit further when I'm finished, maybe not :)

## Run unittests
```bash
python -m unittest discover
```
